# Curve Builder
## A project about bezier curves

### Description
Unity editor tool to create Bezier curves and evaluate points along the path. The main intention is on building non-orthogonal roads between intersections. Other uses include dropping fence prefabs along a path to match grounded height.

Later, this would also be cool to use for projectile trajectories

##TODO
* fix uv coordinates on stretched roads
* extrude shape editor / extrude mesh
* build meshes from curves in editor (ie, bake curves)
* detail meshes with curve normal offset (ex, streetlights)
* detail meshes aligned to curve (ex, fences)
